The deployment of resources in public clouds like Microsoft Azure can be done in a number of ways, and not all of them will implicitly mean that the resulting configuration is sufficiently secure to avoid unintended information disclosure or security breaches. In an attempt to address potential issues in this area we have prepared the set of documents listed below, which describe security configuration recommendations and requirements for different types of Azure resources.

The "Secure Configuration Recommendations" documents contains specific recommendations for each technology in question, but the general GSS IT "**IT Security Baseline**" (ITSB) must also always be taken into consideration when developing and implementing services for the company and our customers. The latest "official" version of the ITSB can be found in the ["Resources"](https://intranet.dnvgl.com/support/it/Pages/Digital-Trust-Center-Downloads.aspx) section on the internal "**Digital Trust Center**" site.
