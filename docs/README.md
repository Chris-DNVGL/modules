## VerIT on Azure InfoPackage

DNV GL's usage of Azure services is already quite extensive, but new people within the company are introduced to this platform every week. In order to make sure we work with Azure in a consistent way, and to help people get quickly "up to speed" has GSS IT created an "**information package**" which is mandatory reading for all personnel involved in deploying/managing/configuring services in Azure.

The main "index" for the "*Azure InfoPackage*" is the [**Introduction**](.\AzureInformationPackage\Introduction.html) page. There you find an overview figure with some general remarks, and also links to additional pages covering various relevant topics in more detail.

The *InfoPackage* provides general information about the usage and integration with Microsoft Azure from DNV GL's on-premises infrastructure. The "*Secure Configuration Recommendations*" section (see below), provides more specific recommendations for securing relevant Azure PaaS services in Microsoft Azure.
